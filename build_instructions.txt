There are two basic components to Tales: libtales, a static library which
provides most of the editing logic, and libtales-qt, a Qt-based interface onto
libtales.

Since r6, Tales uses libpng to provide graphics importing and
exporting. For Windows, the necessary headers and .lib files are included in the
source; a prebuilt libpng DLL is found in the lib folder. For other
systems, you will need libpng installed with the header and library files in the
appropriate environment variables. If you can't or don't want to use libpng,
undefine TALES_ENABLE_LIBPNG, which will disable the corresponding
import/export functionality.

==Building libtales==
- On Linux(-like) systems:
  1. Navigate to the "libtales" folder and run the command "make".

- On Windows systems:
  1. Navigate to the "libtales" folder and open the "libtales.sln" Visual
Studio solution.
  2. Build libtales in debug or release mode, as appropriate.
  Building on Windows has been tested with Visual Studio 2010. Other versions
  and compilers may or may not work "out of the box".

==Building libtales-qt==
1. Navigate to the "libtales-qt" folder and open the "libtales-qt.pro" Qt
project file in Qt Creator.
2. Build libtales-qt.pro in debug or release mode, as appropriate.
3. To start the program, run the "tales" executable generated in the build
directory.
libtales-qt is designed for Qt 4, but should build without issue in Qt 5.
