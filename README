The lawyers say I'm supposed to put this in every file, but luckily I don't
think any of them are planning to read my source code. Wish I had the option.
All the code in the project is GNU GPL3. Not such a hard concept, right?

See build_instructions.txt for instructions on building Tales, and "index.html"
in the "manual" folder for an explanation of the program.

Thanks to the following people for their contributions, direct or indirect, to
this project:
* GerbilSoft, for code cleanup and helpful advice
* mcallegari79, for the prebuilt minimal ICU DLLs used in the Windows builds
* Everyone on Sonic Retro and SMS Power who helped test the program
